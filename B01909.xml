         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THE CASE OF THE KERSEY-CLOTHIERS</hi> Inhabiting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Pariſhes of <hi>Hallifax, Bradford, Bingley, Kighley,</hi> and other adjacent Towns and Pariſhes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Weſt-Riding</hi> of the Country of <hi>York,</hi> againſt the <hi>Aulnagers:</hi> Humbly offered to the Honourable Houſe of <hi>COMMONS</hi> in <hi>PARLIAMENT</hi> Aſſembled.</head>
            <p>THE Aulnagers have for about Fourteen years laſt paſt demanded and exacted of the Clothiers for Subſidie and Aulnage of Clothes commonly called Kerſeys, two pence, and two pence half-penny and more, for ſome Seals for ſome of the ſaid Kerſeys, when by Law they ought not to have had nor taken more for any Kerſey than a peny, nor was there ever any more paid before that time for any Kerſey whatſoever, but only a penny.</p>
            <p>The truth of this will appear to this Honourable Houſe by the Teſtimony of ſeveral Perſons, as well Kerſey-makers, Merchants and Factors, as by perſons that have formerly been Collectors of the Subſidy and Aulnage.</p>
            <p>As to the matter of Law the Caſe ſtands thus:</p>
            <p>By the Common Law no Subſidy nor Aulnage was due, but the Statute of 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. giveth Subſidy with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Value, and Aulnage with reſpect of length and breadth: And by the Statute 17 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 2. Subſidy is granted for Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeys after the rate which is to be ſo underſtood with reſpect of Value, and a Penny upon a Kerſey is anſwerable ro four
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:175523:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 47 -->
pence half-penny upon a Broad-Cloth after the rate of Value. It appears by the ſaid Act of 27 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. That Subſidy was granted with reſpect of Value, for there a Scarlet Cloth is to pay Six pence, a half Grain five pence, and a White Cloth four pence: But Kerſeys did not pay any Subſidies or Aulnage untill the aforeſaid Statute of 17 <hi>R.</hi> 2. And by that Statute every man might make Kerſeys of any length he pleaſed, paying Subſidy and Aulnage after the Rate and Value which formerly was paid for other Clothes, and ever ſince that time the Statutes have been expounded, That a Penny is a full Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and Proportion of a Kerſey, and no more has been paid till of late: Nor are the Kerſeys now made better in Value than what they formerly were when a Penny was only paid for them, and no more demanded for them.</p>
            <p>And upon theſe and other weighty Reaſons and Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations was it, That a Decree in his Majeſties Court of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,</hi> in the twelfth year of the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, was made, which Decree is in theſe very words, <hi>(Viz.) It is therefore this preſent day fully and finally Ordered and Decreed, by the Right Honourable</hi> Thomas <hi>Earl of</hi> Suffolk, <hi>Lord High Treaſurer of</hi> England, <hi>Sir</hi> Fulk Grevill <hi>Knight, Chancellour and Under-Treaſurer of this Court, Sir</hi> Lawrence Tanfield <hi>Knight, Lord Chief Baron, and the reſt of the Barons of this Court, That the ſaid Clothiers inhabiting within the Pariſhes of</hi> Hallifax, Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Bingley <hi>and</hi> Kighley, <hi>and other places thereto or neer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning in the County of</hi> York, <hi>ſhall from henceforth only pay the Summ or Rate of one Penny for the Subſidy and Aulnage of every</hi> Kerſey, <hi>and no more, as they have heretofore of long and ancient time uſed and accuſtomed to pay: And that the aforeſaid Clothiers duely paying or tendring the ſaid Penny upon every Kerſey, as aforeſaid, to the Collector or Collectors of the ſaid Subſidy and Aulnage, or to their lawful Deputy or Deputies appointed for the Collecting of the ſame, ſhall be no further moleſted, troubled or vexed, by Seizure, Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or otherwiſe, for any new or further payments touching the ſame, nor ſhall be at any time charged to pay any more than onely one penny for the Subſidy and Aulnage of every Kerſey.</hi> Notwithſtanding which ſaid Decree and the Laws, Statutes and Cuſtoms afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:175523:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 47 -->
the <hi>Aulnagers</hi> have of late Years exacted of the poor Cloath Kerſey-Makers, two pence, and two pence half-penny for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Kerſey</hi> Cloath; and being not able to contend with the <hi>Aulnagers,</hi> have ſometimes ſubmitted to pay their Exactions tho the ſame was contrary to Law, rather than be at the charge of a Suit.</p>
            <p>And it is futher humbly offered to this Honourable Houſe, Whether not only the Office of <hi>Aulnage,</hi> and the duty of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidy (both which are very burthenſom to the poor Clothiers,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Co.</hi> 2 <hi>Inſt.</hi> fol. 60.</note> and to their great diſcouragement) ought to be taken away for theſe or the like Reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the Subſidy was granted upon Cloath, for that the Wooll for the moſt part was Converted into Cloath within this Kingdom: And in former Times Wool might be Tranſported, and then when it was lawful to Tranſport Wool, the King had forty Shillings for every Sack of Wooll ſo Tranſported. But now it is made Felony to carry Wool out of this Realm, and the Cloath made in <hi>England</hi> may be Tranſported, and great Quantities are Tranſported, and thereby great Revenues does arrive to his Majeſty for the Cuſtoms thereof; and as for the Office of the <hi>Aulnager,</hi> the Uſe of that is totally taken away, as appears by the <hi>Stat.</hi> of 29 <hi>El. Cap.</hi> 10.4. <hi>Ja.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap. 2d.</hi> where the truſt in which ſaid Statute, the Truſt of Meaſuring, Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Searching of Cloath, is transferred to certain Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers in every Pariſh, ſworn and bound by Recognizance to perform their Office truly, who muſt ſeal the ſaid Cloaths with a Seal of Lead, containing the length and weight, with the Word <hi>[Searched]</hi> printed upon the Seal, and the Cloath Maker is thereby to affix his Seal of content to every piece; which cloaths and Kerſeys ſo ſealed ſhall not be reſearched: So that by theſe Statutes the <hi>Aulnagers</hi> and Collectors of the Subſidy of <hi>Aulnage,</hi> are diſcharged of their Truſt of viewing, ſearching, and meaſuring of Cloaths, and ſo conſequently not uſefull as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly: And ſince the making of the ſaid Statutes, the <hi>Aulnagers</hi> have forborn to view, ſearch, and ſeal Kerſeys within the ſaid Pariſhes, but have delivered their Seals to the Clothiers, and have ſold them by Meaſures or Numbers, and ſuffered the Clothiers to affix thoſe: ſeals to the Cloaths themſelves, never regarding what Cloaths they did ſo affix them to, all their End and Deſign being only to get Money for their Seals.</p>
